# Intro

This part of the documentation will explain, how to develop TrailCompass.

It is segmented into separate categories for [commons](https://github.com/TrailCompass/commons), [backend](https://github.com/TrailCompass/backend) and [app](https://github.com/TrailCompass/app). Each category describes the entire workflow logic inside that project necessary to understand the architecture.

**Always read TODO messages in code!** We use them not only to mark something as to fix it before release, but also for important steps before commiting, publishing releases, etc...

When in doubt, ask in the [Discussion](https://github.com/TrailCompass/backend/discussions)
